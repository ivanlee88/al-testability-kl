# Demo 01: Very Tightly Coupled Code

This demo illustrates a lot better code through interfaces.

Points to make:
1. As far as interfaces go, this is good already
2. Procedural mapping of logical IDs (in this example option values) to interfaces is wrong!
3. Adding new interface implementation requires changing code in this codeunit
